    ## Worked example. Weather
    Read this program.

    ```python
    print("What's the weather like?")
    weather = input()
    print(advice)
    ```

    It gives clothing advice. Test it once for every branch.
    Use `if` / `elif` / `else`.

    ## Task 1. People in space

    Read the short program.

    ```python
    from space import people
    number = people()
    print(number, "people in space right now")
    ```

    The number comes from the internet. It is not always the same.

    ### Step 1
    Ask the user to guess (توَقّع).
    Ask: `How many people do you think are in space right now?`
    Keep all 3 lines. Only add lines.

    **New variable:** `guess`.
    **Convert to integer:** `guess = int(input())`

    **Type the lines you added:**
    (Write them in your editor)

    ### Step 2
    Compare `number` with `guess`. Three branches:

    | Guess | Real | Output |
    |---|---|---|
    | 8 | 8 | `That's right!` + `8 people in space right now` |
    | 5 | 8 | `It's actually more than that` + `8 people in space right now` |
    | 9 | 8 | `It's actually fewer than that` + `8 people in space right now` |

    **Use:** `if` / `elif` / `else`. Use `==`, `<`, `>`.

    **Type your full program:**
    (Write it in your editor)

    **Red error (خطأ)? Fix it (صلّحه).** Tick what you found:
